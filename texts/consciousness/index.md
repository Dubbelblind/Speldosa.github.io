# Human contact: the final frontier

I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.

Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes! *Stan Lee never left.* I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition.

## Uh, no, you got the wrong number, this is 9-1…2

Thank you, steal again. You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"

1. I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!
2. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies.
3. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway.

### Fame was like a drug, but what was even more like a drug were the drugs

Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies. I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.

* Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems.
* Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.
* Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.

Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Human contact: the final frontier. Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot.

Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Homer no function beer well without. Ahoy hoy? Human contact: the final frontier. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*

Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.

I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me.

## Another random heading

When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun. Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love!

Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*

Duffman can't breathe! OH NO! This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story." He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns."

I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.

Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love!

Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer? Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.

I hope I didn't brain my damage. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies. I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people.
