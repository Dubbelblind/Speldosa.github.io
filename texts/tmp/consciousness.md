This is a super early draft. I need to fix the following:

- [ ] Automatic numbering of figures.
- [ ] Automatic generation of references.
- [ ] Turn on and off tractatus numbering.
- [ ] Create a first early draft of the content.

This will be a text about consciousness. It's not ready yet. It will keep chaning all the time.

This is the first draft. Right now, I'm just putting in some text here in order for there to be some. Text that is. But it doesn't really mean anything. Or rather, I don't intend for it to mean anything useful.

1. Ok.
2. No way!
3. Ok again!

Please come back later!

# This is the first heading

Some more test text goes here. Nothing to see though.

Here comes a test figure.

<figure class="figure">
	<img src="./images/test.svg">
	<figcaption class="figure_caption">Figure 1. Figure text goes here. Make sure to write something interesting, otherwise noone will read it, and that would be a shame ;(</figcaption>
</figure>

Wow! That was fun!
