This is a currated list of the best Mac programs that I've come across and that I use on a regular basis.

# 1 General
## 1.1 Screen saver
[Aerial](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial).

## 1.2 Managing windows
[SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/) is one of those pieces of software that really should come bundled with every copy of MacOS (this is one area where Windows does it better straight out of the box). Just hold down a certain combination of keys and your active window will resize itself and move to the spot of your chosing.

## 1.3 OS system color
[Flux](https://justgetflux.com).

## 1.4 Monitoring hard drive usage
[Space radar](https://github.com/zz85/space-radar/tree/master).

## 1.5 Flashing SD cards 
[Etcher](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher). Something that you might want to use to flash [OTTO](https://github.com/topisani/OTTO/) to a SD card.
