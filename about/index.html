	<h4>About this site</h4>
	<p>This site is my repository on the internet. It's where I will post and organize all the content that I've created and that I think is worth sharing. This site is still under construction, so expect it to change from time to time.</p>

	<p>This site is hosted at <img src="/images/GithubLogo.svg" class=icon> <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>, which runs <img src="/images/JekyllIcon.svg" class=iconJekyll> <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the deus ex machina of the web. To hear more about it, listen to <a href="http://5by5.tv/webahead/54">this episode of The Web Ahead</a>. If you want to host your own site on Github, I can warmly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWjCJDeWfDdfVEcLGAfdJn_HXyM4Y7_k-">Tomas Bradley YouTube tutorials</a> on the matter.

	<h4>Other sites that I like</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><img src="/images/StackExchangeIcon.png" class=icon> <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> is one of those sites that really makes you appreciate the power of the internet. It's a Q&A site where you can ask just about anything, as well as browsing the humonguosly large archive of already posed questions. I don't know how many times I've saved myself hours upon hours of frustration just by checking Stack Exchange first.

		<li><img src="/images/VimeoIcon.svg" class=icon> <a href="http://www.vimeo.com">Vimeo</a> is a video site that really deserves all the credit that it can get. Being a real long-runner on the internet, it has always been one of my favorite places to go whenever I need inspiration or when I just want to <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/speldosa">share my latest creations</a>. The fact that the site doesn't (and never will) feature any video adds, that it has a thriving and friendly community, and that the quality of the videos (both regarding the content and the technical aspects) are top-notch, makes it a really unique place.</li>
