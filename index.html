				<p>Currently, I'm a PhD student at <a href="http://ki.se/en/the-division-of-psychology">The Division of Psychology</a> at <a href="http://ki.se/en/startpage">Karolinska Institutet</a> in Stochkolm. I sing in <a href="http://www.stockholmsuniversitetskor.se">Stockholm's University Choir</a>, and I'm leadning <a href="http://www.filmbasen.se">Filmbasen's</a> film club <a href="http://www.filmbasen.se/node/78351">Ã…terklippning</a>.</p>

				<h4>About this site</h4>
				<p>This is a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github page</a>. If you're interested in starting your own website, you really should check this resource out!

				<h4>Other sites that I like</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> is one of those sites that really makes you appreciate the power of the internet. It's a Q&A site where you can ask just about anything, as well as browsing the humonguosly large archive of already posed questions. I don't know how many times I've saved myself hours upon hours of frustration just by checking Stack Exchange first.

					<li><a href="http://www.vimeo.com">Vimeo</a> is a video site that really deserves all the credit that it can get. Being a real long-runner on the internet, it has always been one of my favorite places to go whenever I need inspiration or when I just want to <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/speldosa">share my latest creations</a>. The fact that the site doesn't (and never will) feature any video adds, that it has a thriving and friendly community, and that the quality of the videos (both regarding the content and the technical aspects) are top-notch, makes it a really unique place.</li>
