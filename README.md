# To do

## Primary:
- Use Jekyll to create a header (and possibly a footer).
- Fix CSS for headnings. (Some should be centered, some shouldn't.)
- Tweak the design (for example when it comes to the left and right margins of the text).
- Fix the layout and the content of the movie page.
- Fix the layout and the content of the music page.
- Save down the old blog.
- Point www.martinlarsson.net to this adress.
- Fix Google Analytics on the page.


## Secondary:
- Write small summaries for each article.
- Migrate old blog posts that are good to the new site.
- Maybe I should call "blog" "essays" instead.
- Create a HTML version of the master thesis. (Make a habit of always making both a PDF and a HTML version of all articles.)
- Make categories for the different pages just as ia has done for https://ia.net/de/know-how.
- See if you can find a better font.
