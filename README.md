# To-do

## Primary:
- Move domains to new domain registrator (Hover?) (Buy new domain while you're at it).
- Fix with meta-data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJQNJcm-edk
- Design the look and feel of the essay post page.
	- Fix it so that the title get its own font.
	- Footnotes?
	- Source/references?
- Should permalinks to essays be in date folders? Or should they be placed in folders according tags or something? Can we use pages instead of posts? Figure all this out.
- Make the final version of Unit 153.
- Upload everything connected to the essay pages.
- Make the dot in the logo take on a random color from a list every time the site is loaded. Make the links the same color (but in a darker/less saturated version).
	- Yellow version.
	- Teal version.
	- Blue version.
	- Green version?
- Fix mp3-versions of the arranged songs. (Wait until you have fixed the script.)
- Tweak the phone interface:
	- Make a new footer menu (hamburger?) for the phone interface.


## Secondary:
- Write small summaries for each article. (Maybe make it so that there is some kind of fold out text. Should the summary description work the same way? Or should the text there be displayed directly?)
- See if you can find a better font.
- Migrate old blog posts that are good to the new site.
- Make a Swedish version of the site.
	- Make items for "articles", "music", "movie", and "software". Include English and Swedish front matter to make it easier to edit.
- Create the Billie Jean segment from the Kling Kokos concert.
- Create a RSS feed.

## Maybe:
- Create a section called books where I put reference texts that constantly are updated.
- Make categories for the different pages just as ia has done for https://ia.net/de/know-how. (<- I don't know if this is necessary until I get more content on the site.)
- Create a HTML version of the master thesis.
