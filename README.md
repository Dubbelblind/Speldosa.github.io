# To-do

## Primary:
- Design the look and feel of the essay post page.
	- The layout.
	- Fix it so that the title get its own font.
	- Footnotes?
	- Source/references?
- Make the final version of Unit 153.
- 'Essays' or 'texts'? I'm still not sure. 
- Upload everything connected to the text pages.
- Migrate old blog posts that are good to the new site.
- Work with sitemaps
	- Do the rest of what's being mentioned in [http://www.relishtraymedia.com/blog/bid/257788/SEO-Sitelinks-How-to-Get-Google-Subheadings-in-Search-Results](this article).
	- Resolve the error Google Search Console throws regarding a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302](302 error).
	- Expand the sitemap even further. See [https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/4581190?hl=en&ref_topic=4581352](Google's page about it).
- Check the resources for [http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/](data files) and for [http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/](collections). Is this something that I should put to use going further?
- [https://youtu.be/H4Fc2xL79nU](Make the CSS better organized).
- Make the dot in the logo take on a random color from a list every time the site is loaded. Make the links the same color (but in a darker/less saturated version).
	- Pink version.
	- Yellow version.
	- Teal version.
	- Blue version.
	- Green version.
- Write small summaries for each article. (Maybe make it so that there is some kind of fold out text. Should the summary description work the same way? Or should the text there be displayed directly?)
- See if you can find a better font.

## Secondary:
- Make a Swedish version of the site.
	- Make items for "articles", "music", "movie", and "software". Include English and Swedish front matter to make it easier to edit.
	- Should I create an official subdomain with my registrar or something?
- Update photo of yourself.
- Fix mp3-versions of the arranged songs. (Wait until you have fixed the script.)
- Create a RSS feed.
- - Create the Billie Jean segment from the Kling Kokos concert.

## Maybe:
- Create a new main index page that features the latest updates. Or something.
- Create a section called books where I put reference texts that constantly are updated.
- Make categories for the different pages just as ia has done for https://ia.net/de/know-how. (<- I don't know if this is necessary until I get more content on the site.)
- Create a HTML version of the master thesis. 

## Idead:
- When you publish something with someone who has a homepage, link to that page.
