# To-do

## Primary:
- Find a e-mail icon and put it on the index-page before the email.
- Design the look and feel of the essay post page.
	- Fix it so that the title get its own font.
	- Footnotes?
	- Source/references?
- Tweak the design (for example when it comes to the left and right margins of the text).
- Point www.martinlarsson.net to this adress. (It's underway.)
- Fix Google Analytics on the page. (Wait until the DNS have been resolved.)
- Put in a mail symbol for the mail contact and a bird for the tweet contact.
- Fix mp3-versions of the arranged songs. (Wait until you have fixed the script.)
- Make the dot in the logo take on a random color from a list every time the site is loaded. Make the links the same color (but in a darker/less saturated version).


## Secondary:
- Create folders for each subsection so that the URL gets nicer.
- Tweak the design of the whole site (for example, think about how you want your headnings to look; should some of them be centered?).
- Fix with meta-data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJQNJcm-edk
- See if you can find a better font.
- Migrate old blog posts that are good to the new site.
- Write small summaries for each article. (Make it so that there is some kind of fold out text.)
- Write small summaries for each essay. 
- Do a Swedish version of the site.
- Make items for "articles", "music", "movie", and "software". Include English and Swedish front matter to make it easier to edit.
- Create the Billie Jean segment from the Kling Kokos concert.


## Maybe:
- Create a HTML version of the master thesis. 
- Make categories for the different pages just as ia has done for https://ia.net/de/know-how. (<- I don't know if this is necessary until I get more content on the site.)
