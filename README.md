# To-do

## Primary:
- Tweak the design (for example when it comes to the left and right margins of the text).
- Point www.martinlarsson.net to this adress. (It's underway.)
- Fix Google Analytics on the page. (Wait until the DNS have been resolved.)
- Fix mp3-versions of the arranged songs. (Wait until you have fixed the script.)
- Make the path point correctly on an essay page so that it links correctly to the CSS stylesheet. (This goes for all type of links as soon as you navigate away from html files in the root folder.)
- Design the look and feel of the essay post page.


## Secondary:
- Create folders for each subsection so that the URL gets nicer.
- Tweak the design of the whole site (for example, think about how you want your headnings to look; should some of them be centered?).
- Fix with meta-data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJQNJcm-edk
- See if you can find a better font.
- Migrate old blog posts that are good to the new site.
- Write small summaries for each article. (Make it so that there is some kind of fold out text.)
- Write small summaries for each essay. 




## Maybe:
- Create a HTML version of the master thesis. 
- Make categories for the different pages just as ia has done for https://ia.net/de/know-how. (<- I don't know if this is necessary until I get more content on the site.)
