# To do

- Create a HTML version of the master thesis. (Make a habit of always making both a PDF and a HTML version of all articles.)
- Make categories for the different pages just as ia has done for https://ia.net/de/know-how.
- See if you can find a better font.
- Tweak the design (for example when it comes to the left and right margins of the text).
- Maybe I should call "blog" "essays" instead.
