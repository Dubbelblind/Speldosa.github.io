What follows is a list of software that I've written.
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>comment_io</b> - A small [Python] script that helps you to automatically comment or uncomment lines in your code based on commands you've already placed in your file. (<a href="https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/comment_io">CTAN</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/Speldosa/CommentIO">Github</a>)
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>rehersify</b> - A small [Python](https://www.python.org/) script that uses [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) to create rehersal music files out of individual music files containing single voices. (<a href="https://github.com/Speldosa/rehersify">Github</a>)
