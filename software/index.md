What follows is a selection of software that I've written.

* **comment_io** - A small [Python](https://www.python.org/) script that helps you to automatically comment or uncomment lines in your code based on commands you've already placed in your file. ([CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/comment_io)) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Speldosa/comment_io))
* **rehersify** - A small [Python](https://www.python.org/) script that uses [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) to create rehersal music files out of individual music files containing single voices. ([GitHub](https://github.com/Speldosa/rehersify))
